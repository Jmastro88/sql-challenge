# SQL-Challenge

## Challenge Intro/Objective
Performe, Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis on employment data using SQL and SQL related tools.

## Methods Used
 ### Data Modeling
  * Inspected the CSVs and sketch out an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of the tables. 
     
     
        Tools: - Excel
     
               - Python
            
               - http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.
            
 ### Data Engineering
  * Used the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
  * Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

                - PostGreSQL
 ### Data Analysis
Once you have a complete database, do the following:
  1.	Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
  2.	Listed employees who were hired in 1986.
  3.	Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
  4.	Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  5.	Listed all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  6.	Listed all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  7.	Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  8.	Listed the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name, in decending order.
  
          Tools:  - PostgreSQL 
         
  ### Additional Analysis
  1.	Imported the SQL database into Python Pandas. 
  2.	Created a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
  3.	Created a bar chart of average salary by title.
  
          Tools: - Python
      
                - SQLAlchemy
